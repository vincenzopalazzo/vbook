### Numbers

```v
a := 123
```

This will assign the value of 123 to `a`. By default `a` will have the
type `int`.

You can also use hexadecimal, binary or octal notation for integer literals:

```v
a := 0x7B
b := 0b01111011
c := 0o173
```

All of these will be assigned the same value, 123. They will all have type
`int`, no matter what notation you used.

V also supports writing numbers with `_` as separator:

```v
num := 1_000_000 // same as 1000000
three := 0b0_11 // same as 0b11
float_num := 3_122.55 // same as 3122.55
hexa := 0xF_F // same as 255
oct := 0o17_3 // same as 0o173
```

If you want a different type of integer, you can use casting:

```v
a := i64(123)
b := byte(42)
c := i16(12345)
```

Assigning floating point numbers works the same way:

```v
f := 1.0
f1 := f64(3.14)
f2 := f32(3.14)
```
If you do not specify the type explicitly, by default float literals
will have the type of `f64`.

Float literals can also be declared as a power of ten:
```v
f0 := 42e1 // 420
f1 := 123e-2 // 1.23
f2 := 456e+2 // 45600
```
